# GridMaker
Welcome to our Grid, where you can add rows and columns to a table. Not only that but you can remove rows and columns as well. If that sounds boring to you, you can set any cell to one out of many colors that we provide. You can choose from Navy, Sky Blue, Aqua, Indigo, Lavender, Pink, Red, Magenta, Peach, Black, White, Orange, Yellow, Lime Green, and Forest Green. Have fun and enjoy!!
